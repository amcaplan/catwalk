# CatWalk

This is a nonsensical game developed for my RubyConf 2021 talk, _The Audacious Array_.

It requires Ruby 2.7 or above.

You also need to install some gems:

```sh
gem install timecop
gem install curses
```

It might not work on Windows without some extra stuff installed, see [here](https://gist.github.com/amcaplan/426a6bdf2f06c4fdb3d6d69136e35515#gistcomment-3532005).

To play the game, run from the root directory:

```sh
ruby catwalk.rb
```

Instructions are on the right inside the game. Have fun!
